## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Junianto Endra Kartika, currently pursuing a degree in computer science at Universitas Dian Nuswantoro. This website is crafted using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with a theme curated by [satnaing](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).

## Tech Stack

My expertise lies in Android Development, where I've honed my skills in Dart, Kotlin, Java, and JavaScript (React Native). I've successfully contributed to projects for various companies and undertaken personal initiatives in this domain.

Venturing into Web Development, I've delved into JavaScript and PHP, leveraging Laravel as my preferred PHP Framework and React as the JavaScript Framework for my university projects.

Beyond my core areas, I find joy in experimenting with Python and Java, utilizing them to embark on exciting projects such as Chat Bot such with Discord nor Telegram, Web Scraping, Machine Learning, and Minecraft Plugins. It's all about the thrill of exploration and bringing ideas to life!

<!-- AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. I designed and crafted this based on [my personal blog](https://satnaing.dev/blog).

This theme is aimed to be accessible out of the box. Light and dark mode are supported by
default and additional color schemes can also be configured.

This theme is self-documented \_ which means articles/posts in this theme can also be considered as documentations. So, see the documentation for more info.
